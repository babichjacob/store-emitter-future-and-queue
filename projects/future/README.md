<h1 align="center">🔮 Future</h1>

This library provides a destructuring of [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) so that you can `resolve` or `reject` it later. This makes it feel like a [`Future` from Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-future.html#future-object).

npm install --save-dev @babichjacob/future
